      Do you have an error log of what happened? If you don't see any errors, make sure that error reporting is enabled (`/console scriptErrors 1`) or install [BugSack](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bugsack) & [BugGrabber](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bug-grabber), yes both are needed.
      Note that if the error looks like `[string "--[[ Error in ' my awesome aura' ]` then the bug is in the aura that got mentioned, not in WeakAuras itself.
